# Contributing

Thanks for contributing to FreeGLM. Keep changes focused on a concrete
problem. For a new capability or an MCP interface change, open an issue first so
the scope and compatibility impact can be discussed.

## Development setup

FreeGLM supports Python 3.10 and newer. From a checkout, install the
dependencies needed for the area you are changing:

```bash
scripts/dev-install.sh          # base dependencies
scripts/dev-install.sh core     # core and visualization
scripts/dev-install.sh all      # full runtime profile
```

See [local development](docs/en/local_development.md) for source and harness
debugging, and [adding a capability](docs/en/how_to_add_new_capability.md) for
the repository layout and registration steps.

## Making changes

- Keep capability-specific code under `src/capabilities/<name>/`; put code in
  `src/shared/` only when multiple capabilities use it.
- Preserve existing MCP tool names, inputs, and outputs unless the change is
  required to fix functionality. Explain any interface change in the PR.
- Import optional dependencies lazily and declare non-Python tools in the
  capability's `SYSTEM_DEPS` table.
- Do not commit API keys, credentials, private media, generated artifacts, or
  machine-specific configuration.
- Add or update tests and documentation when behavior changes.

## Verification

Run the relevant targeted tests while developing, then run:

```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/
python3 scripts/check_manifests.py
python3 scripts/check_security_contract.py
bash -n install.sh
ruff format .
ruff check .
```

If a test needs credentials, a GUI application, GPU hardware, or another
environment not available to you, state what was not run in the PR.

## Pull requests

Describe the problem and the reason for the chosen fix, link related issues,
and include the commands and results used for verification. Keep unrelated
changes in separate PRs.
