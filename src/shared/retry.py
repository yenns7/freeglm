"""One retry/backoff policy for the network clients.

api_openai (chat), api_dashscope (async services) and core's serper client all need the
same attempt/backoff loop; before this they hand-rolled four slightly different copies.
This centralizes the *mechanism* while leaving each caller's policy (attempt count, backoff
shape, which errors are retryable, and whether to raise or return None on exhaustion) as
call-site arguments — different endpoints legitimately warrant different policies.
