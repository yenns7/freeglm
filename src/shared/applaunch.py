"""Helpers for the thin-client capabilities that can bring up their own live app.

The blender/freecad MCP servers are thin clients: they talk to a *running* Blender/FreeCAD that
carries a vendored addon. Normally the user starts that app themselves, but each server also exposes
a `--launch-app` subcommand (wired in `mcp_framework.run_main` → the package's `launch_app()`), so a
plugin-install user with no repo checkout can still get the other half of the pipeline up with one
command. This module is the shared, stdlib-only plumbing those launchers compose:

  - is_port_open / wait_for_port   — TCP readiness (the app's RPC port)
  - resolve_binary                 — locate the app binary on PATH (with login-shell PATH recovery)
  - auto_install_enabled / apps_cache_dir / download_file — rootless auto-download of a missing app
  - autolaunch_display_hint        — Linux-only xvfb prerequisite diagnosis
  - wrap_xvfb                      — use xvfb on Linux; launch the native GUI elsewhere
  - spawn_detached / run_foreground — start the app, backgrounded (return once ready) or blocking
  - autolaunch_enabled / is_local_host / launch_and_probe / startup_probe — the client-side
    autolaunch-on-first-connect + startup-probe logic shared by the blender/freecad loaders

Part of the `shared` library (src/shared/) — no third-party deps (stdlib urllib for the download,
since the blender/freecad extras declare no pip deps of their own).

# ── rootless auto-download of a missing app ──────────────────────────
#
# A plugin-install user often has no Blender/FreeCAD on the box (and, if they installed via a distro,
# a version too old for what the model trained on). Both apps ship a relocatable Linux-x86_64 build
# that extracts anywhere with no root (Blender: a tarball; FreeCAD: an AppImage we `--appimage-extract`
# to be FUSE-free), so the launchers can fetch a pinned build into the user cache. The app-specific
# URLs + layout live in each capability's `_launch.py`; the mechanics are here. The one prerequisite
# this can NOT satisfy on headless Linux is a display: xvfb needs root to install (see
# autolaunch_display_hint). Other desktop platforms launch the native GUI directly.
