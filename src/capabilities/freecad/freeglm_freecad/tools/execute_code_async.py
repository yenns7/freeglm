        "FreeCAD document tree directly. This tool runs the submitted code in a background thread "
        "and returns immediately. Because it does not run on FreeCAD's main GUI thread, the code "
        "must NOT call FreeCADGui APIs, manipulate the active view or selection, create or edit "
        "document objects, change object properties, call doc.recompute(), or save documents. For "
        "code that touches FreeCAD documents, document objects, FreeCADGui, the active view, "
        "selection, recompute, or save operations, use execute_code instead — execute_code runs on "
        "the FreeCAD GUI thread and is the safe default for normal FreeCAD automation. Use "
        "execute_code_async only for background-safe work such as long-running pure OCCT geometry "
        "calculations (e.g. fuse/cut/loft on already-fetched shapes) or other CPU-bound "
        "computations that do not interact with the document or GUI. Typical usage pattern: "
        "(1) Fetch shapes into local variables first (via execute_code on the GUI thread). "
        "(2) Store intermediate results in a module-level Python variable (not in the FreeCAD "
        "document) so execute_code can read them later. (3) Run the heavy computation via "
        "execute_code_async. (4) After the expected computation time has elapsed, apply results to "
        "the document via execute_code (which runs on the GUI thread)."
