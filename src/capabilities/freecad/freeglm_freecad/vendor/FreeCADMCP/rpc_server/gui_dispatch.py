"""GUI-thread task dispatch for the RPC server.

The XML-RPC server runs in its own thread. FreeCAD APIs that touch the GUI
or the document tree must run in the main GUI thread. This module owns the
queue that ferries wrapped callables onto the GUI thread and the helper that
RPC handlers use to invoke them.

Robustness and performance guarantees:

1. Per-call response queues: each ``dispatch_to_gui`` call owns its own
   ``queue.Queue``. A timeout in one call can never corrupt the response for
   a subsequent call.
2. Immediate wake via Qt signal: ``dispatch_to_gui`` emits a signal from the
   RPC thread; the GUI thread processes the task immediately rather than
   waiting for the next 500 ms heartbeat tick. The 500 ms heartbeat is kept
   only as a fallback.
3. Mouse-button guard: ``process_gui_tasks`` skips the current tick while
   mouse buttons are held so MCP tasks cannot interrupt 3D navigation drags.
4. Clean shutdown: the ``_SHUTDOWN`` sentinel sets a flag that suppresses the
   ``finally`` reschedule, so ``stop_rpc_server`` actually stops the loop.
5. Exception isolation: exceptions inside a task are caught, logged, and
   returned as error strings; they never kill the dispatch loop.
