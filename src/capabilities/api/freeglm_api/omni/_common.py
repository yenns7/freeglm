"""Shared plumbing for the omni-av tools (not a tool itself — exports no TOOL/handle).

Every tool is the same shape: validate input → route the file to an audio or video content part →
either preview the request (``dry_run``) or call the Omni model and parse strict JSON. ``run_omni``
centralizes that so each tool module is just its prompt + args model + output formatting.

A local file can only be sent inline, as base64, and the endpoint caps that at 10 MB encoded (≈ 7 MB
of file — ``OMNI_MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES``), so local media is fitted to that budget first:

* audio (the ASR family): a file that already fits travels untouched; otherwise the track is pulled to
  16 kHz mono — lossless wav while that fits, else MP3 at the highest bitrate the budget affords.
* video (the AV tools): frames are smart_resize'd into ``max_pixels``, the frame rate is capped at the
  server's sampling ``fps``, and the result is bitrate-fitted under the budget.

A video too long to fit that way (roughly > 9 min at the default 1 fps / 448²) stops being squeezed
and switches strategy instead of shipping a request the endpoint would reject:

* with OSS configured — the transcode is uploaded and passed by signed URL, which has no size cap at
  all (Qwen3.5-Omni fetches up to 2 GB / 1 h server-side);
* without OSS — the video is decomposed into a uniformly sampled frame list plus its (fitted) audio
  track, which Omni combines into one clip; a note states each frame's timestamp, since the frame-list
  form carries no time base of its own.

If ffmpeg/ffprobe is unavailable or the transcode fails outright, the original file is sent unchanged
(the server then does its own sampling) — but only when the original already fits the budget.
