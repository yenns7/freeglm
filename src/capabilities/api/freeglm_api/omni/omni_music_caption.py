"""Omni Music Caption — global music analysis: genre/mood/instrument/vocal/key/tempo tags + a dense caption.

Audio-only, whole-track analysis (NO timestamps, NO per-section breakdown). Deliberately scoped to
the fields the model reports reliably — chord progressions, melodic detail, and production techniques
are intentionally excluded (they were unreliable in practice).
