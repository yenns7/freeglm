_PROMPT = """
Please provide a detailed description of the video. It must explicitly include three primary sections as defined below. Additionally, you are required to include two specific analytical sections to identify content that is inappropriate for minors.

### Section 1: Storyline
Provide a structured chronological storyline of every noticeable audio and visual detail.
*   **Requirement:** In the storyline, if a segment contains content potentially harmful to minors (graphic violence, gore, dangerous acts, bullying, or inappropriate adult themes), you must append the following at the end of that specific paragraph: **[FLAG: <Category> - <Severity: Low/Medium/High>]**.

### Section 2: Visible Text
Provide a structured list of all visible text. For each text element, include start timestamp, end timestamp, the exact text content, and the appearance characteristics. If no text appears, explicitly state: "No text appears."

### Section 3: Speakers and Transcript
Provide a structured speech-to-text transcription. Include the speaker (corresponding to the character or voice-over, including accent and tone), exact spoken content, start timestamp, end timestamp, and speaking state (prosody, emotion, and style). If no speech appears, explicitly state: "No speech appears."

### Section 4: Compliance Alert (Summary)
Provide a table summarizing all flagged segments for quick review:
| Time Range | Category | Risk Level | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| xx:xx - xx:xx | e.g., Violence | High | e.g., Realistic physical assault observed. |

### Section 5: Summary of Safety Findings
Provide a final assessment on whether the video is suitable for minors, citing the most critical timestamps and explaining the overall risk profile. Apply a zero-tolerance policy; if there is ambiguity regarding whether a scene is harmful, err on the side of caution.
