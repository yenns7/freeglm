"""FreeGLM api: cloud APIs for understanding media, grouped by model family.

A pure-tools MCP server. Each module under ``vl/`` / ``omni/`` / ``others/`` exports ``TOOL`` +
``handle`` and is auto-discovered by the framework:

* ``vl/`` — a Qwen-VL model (OpenAI-compatible endpoint): vision_chat, ocr, grounding.
* ``omni/`` — the Qwen-Omni model, reading video frames AND the embedded audio track together:
  omni_asr(+_timestamped / multi_speaker), omni_av_caption / grounding / counting, omni_music_caption.
* ``others/`` — services that are neither: transcribe_audio (Qwen3-ASR) and segmentation (SAM3).

Local file reading/visualization lives in ``core``; fact-finding/confirmation lives in ``search``.
